# What are APIs?

### Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

What is even more exciting however is the functionality built on top of the client-side JavaScript language. So-called Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide you with extra superpowers to use in your JavaScript code.  

#### **What are APIs?**

APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that would otherwise be hard or impossible to implement. They do the same thing for programming that ready-made furniture kits do for home building — it is much easier to take ready-cut panels and screw them together to make a bookshelf than it is to work out the design yourself, go and find the correct wood, cut all the panels to the right size and shape, find the correct-sized screws, and then put them together to make a bookshelf.

#### **Browser APIs**

Browser APIs are built into your web browser, and are able to expose data from the surrounding computer environment, or do useful complex things. For example:

* **DOM or Document Object Model API** - allows you to manipulate HTML and CSS, creating, removing and changing HTML, dynamically applying new styles to your page, etc. Every time you see a popup window appear on a page, or some new content displayed (as we saw above in our simple demo) for example, that's the DOM in action.

* **The Geolocation API** - retrieves geographical information. This is how Google Maps is able to find your location and plot it on a map.

* **The Canvas and WebGL APIs** - allow you to create animated 2D and 3D graphics. People are doing some amazing things using these web technologies — see Chrome Experiments and webglsamples.

* **Audio and Video APIs** - like HTMLMediaElement and WebRTC allow you to do really interesting things with multimedia, such as play audio and video right in a web page, or grab video from your web camera and display it on someone else's computer (try our simple Snapshot demo to get the idea).

### **Third Party APIs**

Third party APIs are not built into the browser by default, and you generally have to grab their code and information from somewhere on the Web.

***For example:***

* The **Twitter API** allows you to do things like displaying your latest tweets on your website.

* The **Google Maps API** and **OpenStreetMap API** allows you to embed custom maps into your website, and other such functionality.
