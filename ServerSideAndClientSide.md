# Server-side versus client-side code

You might also hear the terms server-side and client-side code, especially in the context of web development. 


### ***Client-side code***  
is code that is ***run on the user's computer*** â€” when a web page is viewed, the page's client-side code is downloaded, then run and displayed by the browser. In this module we are explicitly talking about ***client-side JavaScript***.

### ***Server-side code*** 
is ***run on the server***, then its results are downloaded and displayed in the browser. Examples of popular server-side web languages include:
 * ğŸ”¥ PHP  
 * ğŸ”¥ Python
 * ğŸ”¥ Ruby  
 * ğŸ”¥ ASP.NET
 * ğŸ”¥ JavaScript  
 
**_NOTE_**: *JavaScript can also be used as a server-side language, for example in the popular Node.js environment.*
